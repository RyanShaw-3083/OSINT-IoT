# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) for IoT

There is a man without any IoT cloud and MEC service.
But he is keen to collect and analyse public data on all the IoT...

Feel free to report issue for adding more and more useful link(s).

<cite>I click almost half an hour to find out a little part of Thingful's data source.</cite>

## TL;DR
Scan the whole Internet (IPv4/v6 space) to find any IoT things is so h('a'*1024)rdly ... But that's a effective way to grab more data!
The IoT is combining our life and cyberspace so close even blurring the red-line of between virtual and reality. In some way, IoT is "dangerous" for us if this giant system lose security control. 

Go back to 1999, "Do you need a mobile phone?".

Are there anybody can told me how to register xivly.com to get public feed data? T^T
